<h2>What is KeyLogger?</h2>
<p>KeyLoggers are a particularly insidious type of spyware that can record and steal consecutive keystrokes such as <b>Passwords</b>, <b>Usernames</b>, <b>SSN #'s</b>, <b>Credit Card #'s</b> (and much more) that the user enters on a device.</p>
as you may tell, the definition and concept may seem basic but the power of such tool is endless.

in the source code.. you'll notice the comments where you need to adjust path for saving the Text file that will record your input.

<h2>How to use it?</h2>
<p>You need to know that these few line will be detected from your anti-virus, so you'll need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Having "pynput" module is a must, to download it use the command <u><b>pip3 install pynput</b></u> in your CMD/Bash.
  </li>  
  <li>
    Turn off Real-time protection on your anti-virus application.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add This file as an Exclusion (exception) from defender threat scan.
  </li>
  * not doing above points will cause the file to be erased.
</ol>
<h4>It is completely safe and you can delete it in any point.</h6>

Lastly, run the code and start typing, you'll see the file is been saved in desired folder repeatedly as you type. Enjoy :]
